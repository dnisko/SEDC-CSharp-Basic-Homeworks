    Task 1

    Create a class Dog
    Add properties: Name, breed, color
    The dog needs to have an Eat method that returns a message: The dog is now eating.
    A Play method returning a message : The dog is now playing.
    And a ChaseTail method that returns a message: The dog is now chasing it's tail.
    The user needs to create a dog object by using inputs from the console and then choose an option to choose one of the methods mentioned above.
    For example, if he enters 1 to call the Eat method, if he enters 2 to call the Play method or if the user enters 3 to call the ChaseTail method.
